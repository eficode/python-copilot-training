# Example Flask App

This project folder contains an example application that has been almost entirely generated with GitHub Copilot, including this README file.
The purpose of this example app is to demonstrate the capabilities of Copilot in generating code, templates, and other project components.

## Folder Structure

The `example_app` folder is organized as follows:

```bash
example_app/
├── app.py               # The main entry point of the Flask application. It contains the application setup and route definitions.
├── templates/           # A folder containing HTML templates used by the Flask app for rendering views.
├── static/              # A folder for static assets such as CSS, JavaScript, and images.
└── requirements.txt     # A file listing the Python dependencies required to run the application. (This is actually on repository root level)
```

The mistake with `requirements.txt` was intentionally left in this documentation to highlight that Copilot can make mistakes. It's important to
ensure that the code and documentation generated by AI is correct.

## Example: Generating Unit Tests

You can generate unit tests for the example app by for example highlighting relevant rows from `app.py` and
asking Copilot Edits to create tests for you. For example:

`Generate unit tests for #file:app.py:8-20 `
